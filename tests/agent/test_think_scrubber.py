"""Tests for StreamingThinkScrubber.

These tests lock in the contract the scrubber must satisfy so downstream
consumers (ACP, api_server, TTS, CLI, gateway) never see reasoning
blocks leaking through the stream_delta_callback.  The scenarios map
directly to the MiniMax-M2.7 / DeepSeek / Qwen3 streaming patterns that
break the older per-delta regex strip.
